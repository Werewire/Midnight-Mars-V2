I'll be, making an attempt for sure to maintain it, but i might not continue if discord brings out a big update that completely breaks ALL of the CSS because honestly  I found navigating discord's css a little nightmare-ish

-made the scrollbar bright green so its easier to see

KNOWN ISSUES:

-Nitro gift screen doesn't fit in with theme

-Scrollbar on chat uses old theme color on it's non green section

-Create a server button does not fit in with theme

-Discover tab does not fit in with theme
