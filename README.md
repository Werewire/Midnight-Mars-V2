# Midnight-Mars-V2
original theme by LuckFire#4800, uses all of the original code but adds fixes.
I'll be, making an attempt for sure to maintain it, but i might not continue if discord brings out a big update that completely breaks ALL of the CSS because honestly  I found navigating discord's css a little nightmare-ish

The changes I made to it are: 
-making the friends list actually fit in with the theme
-made the scrollbar bright green so its easier to see
